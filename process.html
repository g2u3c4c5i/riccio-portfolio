			<h2>Process</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the process page. If you’ve made it here, you may be interested in how I went about creating this site. Below, I will explain the steps I took to go from a concept to a fully functional website.</p>

			<p>To start, I decided on what kind of look I wanted my website to have. To get some ideas flowing, I visited a few different websites to look for inspiration. My initial sketches took cues from several websites, drawing from <a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">https://www.utm.utoronto.ca</a> for the footer layout, <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/account/about/</a> for the home page content layout, and <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/" target="_blank">https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/</a> for the layout of my contact form.</p>

			<p>Once the research stage was complete, I started thinking about the aesthetic elements for my website. As a professional portfolio, I wanted it to have a sleek and sophisticated look. I went to Adobe Color to come up with a colour palette. I wanted to keep it relatively dark and not too busy, so I decided to stick to a purple colour scheme with black and white as accents. I came out with this as a rough idea of a palette:</p>

			<p>Next, I stuck these colours into the WebAim Contrast Checker to make sure the colours met accessibility standards. I made changes as necessary, and streamlined the palette even further to come to this result:</p>

			<p>Once the palette was decided, I started working on my rich media elements. I collected images of some of my artworks to use in my portfolio, and took some photographs to use as spotlight images across my inner pages. I manipulated the photographs in Adobe Photoshop to make them monochromatic, sometimes changing the colours of objects to purple hues in order to match my aesthetic. Then, I designed a logo in Adobe Illustrator that fit my palette and suited my aesthetic. I settled on a gem as my logo to evokes the sense of sophistication and elegance I hoped to achieve in my design. I also settled on my choice of font, Sukhumvit Set, which I increased the letter spacing of to make it appear more striking and unique. The font has a sort of cute artistic roundness which matched my portfolio, and by using only a single font, my design remained sleek and sophisticated. </p>
			
			<p>Once my rich media elements were all set, I began conceptualizing the layout of my website. This stage took the form of embarrassingly rough sketches, which helped me work out how I would organize my content:</p>
			
			<center><img src="images/sketches1.png" alt="Process Sketches" height="400px;"></center>
			
			<center><img src="images/sketches2.png" alt="Process Sketches" height="400px;"></center>
			
			<p>After completing this stage, I opened Adobe XD to start creating a wireframe design for four of my inner pages: Home, Resume, Portfolio &amp; Contact:</p>
			
			<center><img src="images/wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes" width="1000px"></center>
			
			<p>With my wireframes complete, I was ready to start making a high fidelity prototype. The result was a very close reflection of what my final product would look like, with very few minor changes to the contact page footer that I worked out as I was styling the website:</p>
			
			<center><img src="images/prototype.png" alt="Prototypes" width="1000px"></center>
			
			<p>At this point, all that was left to do was bring my prototype to life, using html and css to build my website with Adobe Dreamweaver.</p>
			
			<p>While creating my website, I took several measures to ensure my content met accessibility standards. As previously mentioned, I used WebAim Contrast Checker to make sure the colours would be readable, with a contrast ratio of at least 7:1. I also added descriptive alt tags to all my rich media content to make sure the content could be picked up by a screen reader. Likewise, there are no images of text, so all the text on my web page can be detected by a screen reader. My forms have descriptive labels to serve a similar purpose.</p>
			
			<p>Once my website was all put together, all that was left to do was for me to chronicle the steps I took to create my design, leading to this “process” page which you’ve just finished reading. Ta-da! </p>
			
			<p>There you have it. Thanks for visiting my website! </p>
